## The project
This digital exhibition was created by Brandis Malone as a final project for The Book 1450 to the Present. The goal of this assignment was for students to analyze an aspect of book history they found particularly interesting. 

Students were required to:
* Engage meaningfully with books and demonstrate that they have learned in class how to look at books and why the study of books and their history is important.
* Demonstrate that they can communicate effectively and professionally—facts, deductions, assessments, and stories connected to some aspect of the history of the book.

## The course
The History of the Book from 1450 to the Present is taught by Rebecca Baumann, Head of Public Services and Associate Curator of Modern Books and Manuscripts at the Lilly Library. 

"This is a course about books: beautiful books, ugly books, old books, new books. We will learn how and why books were made at different times and places, and we will also meet some of the people who made the books and think about the people who might have read the books. We will focus on the book as a cultural object—that is, a physical thing whose physicality matters and which can give us insight into the culture that created it."
