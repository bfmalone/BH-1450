## Exhibition

This is a very small digital exhibition that contains only thirty examples of publisher's bindings from the collections at the Lilly Library in Bloomington, Indiana. The bindings selected reflect the history of decorated cloth binding, the talents of various artists, the different styles and origins, and the changes that took place over the years. 

Publisher's bindings are incredibly interesting to study as they speak to the advancement of the book industry as a whole with the development of machines. The early 19th century saw a shift away from hand-press technology, and instead a switch to the machine and its roaring industry. Tools and techniques utilized in bookmaking changed with the times and made it possible for books to be produced on a massive scale. With this newfound speed, there was a growth in different areas of literature printed and published, and inevitably a change in how books were produced, marketed,  and sold. 

Decorated bindings were made to be pretty on purpose, to catch your eye, and maybe even communicate a bit about the book you wanted to read.  They were made of sturdy book cloth with blind tooling and gilt designs that were beautifully composed and crafted. Over the hundred or so years they were in production, decorated cloth bindings were an integral part of people's experience with reading books. They felt the bindings, selected, them, collected ones they found attractive. Thos who designed these bindings also SOMETHING SOMETHING

In order to explore these facets of book history, this exhibition takes a look at the history of publishersâ€™ bindings themselves, from the early 19th century through to the 1930s. It also examines who these binding designers were, what their stories were, and what they left as their legacy. And finally, it explains some of the unique aspects that went into the production of these stunning bindings.
