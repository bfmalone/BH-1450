## Techniques
The effort that went into creating decorated cloth bindings was no small feat, and the specifics of their production are an incredibly interesting facet of this history. The definitions below cover a handful of essential materials, tools, and techniques that were utilized. All definitions come from the second edition of Geoffry Glaister's Encyclopedia of the Book. 

### Blind Blocking
The impression of lettering or a design onto a binding, made by machine. Blind blocking is specifically the use of blocking without gold leaf.

### Block
A metal stamp used to impress lettering or a design onto a binding. In the case of publisher's bindings, they were normally made of brass.

### Blocking Press
A press that used heated blocks to stamp lettering and designs onto a binding. Can be used for blind or gold blocking.

### Book cloth
Book cloth is dyed and coated calico made to be hardwearing, water-resistant, and capable of being blocked with lettering or designs. The first official book cloth was created in England in 1825, which quickly gained traction through the early 19th century. The first book bound in cloth in the United States was produced shortly after its introduction, in 1827. By 1840, book cloth was incredibly viable production-wise, and so there was a dramatic uptick in books bound in cloth (publishers' bindings!). Modern book cloth utilizes different materials and coatings.

### Die
A specially engraved intaglio stamp for impressing lettering or a design onto a binding.

### Edition Binding
Another word for publishers' or decorated cloth bindings. These types of bindings were machine made and mass produced.

### Gold Blocking 
Once a binding has first been marked or blind tooled/stamped, it was then coated in glair, laid with gold leaf, and stamped using heated dies or blocks in a blocking press. This impression permanently affixed the gold leaf to the intended design. The finished gold design is also known as gilt.

### Gold Blocking Press
A special press that used heated blocks for impressing lettering or a design in gilt onto a binding.

### Gold Leaf
The traditional material used for gilding, spine lettering, or other designs. It's still used today! The gold leaf used tends to be 4 millionths of an inch.

### Glair
An adhesive of egg whites and vinegar put on book covers before blocking or tooling with gold leaf, which makes it stick permanently when a heated tool or die is used for the impression.
