## Blind Tooling
The use of  heated tools to impress a design on the cover without any use of gold, ink, foil, etc. Just to get the impression, lower temps. 

## Bling Stamping 
The use of heated metal stamps, or dies, to impress designs or lettering. 

## Gold Blocking & Tooling
Once a binding has first been marked or blind tooled/stamped, it was then coated in glair, laid with gold leaf, and impressed using heated dies. This impression permanently affixed the gold leaf to the intended design. The finished gold design is also known as gilt. 

## Glair
An adhesive of egg whites and vinegar put on book covers before blocking or tooling with gold leaf, makes it stick permanently when heated tool or die used for impression.
