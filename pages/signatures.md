    {% include index/snippet.html title="How do we know who they were?" text="Unfortunately there are many designers whose names have been lost to history, especially before binding signatures were common. Binding signatures are essentially a small little signature from the artist somewhere on the binding deisgn, like a painting, often just of their initials in one small symbol. These were only common after XXXX, and so before then it's hard to identify people. There are also plenty of signatures that have not been attributed to a designer, especially if they were not notable individual artists." %}
